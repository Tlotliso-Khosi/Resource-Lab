# 🛠️ Custom Assembler Simulator - Educational Assembly Tool

This project introduces a **custom assembler** and a **web-based simulator** that translates user-defined assembly language into machine language. Built for educational purposes and inspired by **MIPS 32 architecture**, this tool offers a simplified and practical experience of how assemblers work in real systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:
- **Design a new assembly language** closely resembling MIPS 32 syntax
- **Build a custom assembler** that converts instructions into equivalent machine code
- **Create a web interface** to simulate the assembler's operation in a user-friendly environment
- **Educate students** on how real-world assemblers function, from parsing to binary translation

---

## 🧠 Background

Assembler design is an advanced topic in computer architecture and systems programming. By building our own assembler and web-based simulator, we provide learners with:
- A practical understanding of **instruction encoding**
- Insight into **register management, ALU operations, and memory access**
- An intuitive way to visualize how high-level logic becomes low-level binary

---

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **Assembler Engine:** Python (for parsing, translating, and encoding)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Architecture Design Inspiration:** MIPS 32
- **Hosting/Simulation:** Web-based interface to run simulated instructions in real-time

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Custom syntax for defining and running assembly instructions
- Binary translation of supported instructions into simulated machine code
- Real-time simulation of instruction execution
- Educational UI for demonstrating register and memory changes
- Inspired by Linux terminal and MIPS 32 interaction patterns

---

## 🌍 Impact

This project serves as a stepping stone for:
- Students learning **computer architecture** and **assembly programming**
- Developers seeking to understand **low-level machine code generation**
- Educational institutions needing **interactive simulation tools** for teaching

By building a simplified but accurate model, the project demystifies how processors interpret and execute instructions.

## 🚀 How to Use

- Not yet complete so on actually how to use is going to be impossible until a full implementation is done.
